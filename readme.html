<p>This is my thorough Bible study I made years ago, although it was in Swedish. With AI I could easily fix a translated English version of the selected passages. Let me know if there is any link that is faulty or passage that is not correct (as AI can hallucinate, however, you should be able to discern if it does. AI is not a literary genius like the authors of these timeless texts.)</p>
<h4 class="atx" id="hebrews-36"><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Hebrews+3%3A6&amp;version=NIV">Hebrews 3:6</a></h4>
<p>"But Christ is faithful as the Son over God's house. And we are his house, if indeed we hold firmly to our confidence and the hope in which we glory."</p>
<h4 class="atx" id="psalm-911-16"><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Psalm+91%3A1-16&amp;version=NIV">Psalm 91:1-16</a></h4>
<p>"Whoever dwells in the shelter of the Most High will rest in the shadow of the Almighty. I will say of the Lord, 'He is my refuge and my fortress, my God, in whom I trust.' ... 'Because he loves me,' says the Lord, 'I will rescue him; I will protect him, for he acknowledges my name. He will call on me, and I will answer him; I will be with him in trouble, I will deliver him and honor him. With long life I will satisfy him and show him my salvation.'"</p>
<h4 class="atx" id="psalm-8916-18"><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Psalm+89%3A16-18&amp;version=NIV">Psalm 89:16-18</a></h4>
<p>"They rejoice in your name all day long; they celebrate your righteousness. For you are their glory and strength, and by your favor you exalt our horn. Indeed, our shield belongs to the Lord, our king to the Holy One of Israel."</p>
<h4 class="atx" id="matthew-1624-25"><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+16%3A24-25&amp;version=NIV">Matthew 16:24-25</a></h4>
<p>"Then Jesus said to his disciples, 'Whoever wants to be my disciple must deny themselves and take up their cross and follow me. For whoever wants to save their life will lose it, but whoever loses their life for me will find it.'"</p>
<h4 class="atx" id="2-timothy-223-26"><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2+Timothy+2%3A23-26&amp;version=NIV">2 Timothy 2:23-26</a></h4>
<p>"Don't have anything to do with foolish and stupid arguments, because you know they produce quarrels. And the Lord's servant must not be quarrelsome but must be kind to everyone, able to teach, not resentful. Opponents must be gently instructed, in the hope that God will grant them repentance leading them to a knowledge of the truth, and that they will come to their senses and escape from the trap of the devil, who has taken them captive to do his will."</p>
<h4 class="atx" id="1-corinthians-1521-22"><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+Corinthians+15%3A21-22&amp;version=NIV">1 Corinthians 15:21-22</a></h4>
<p>"For since death came through a man, the resurrection of the dead comes also through a man. For as in Adam all die, so in Christ all will be made alive."</p>
<h4 class="atx" id="philippians-48"><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Philippians+4%3A8&amp;version=NIV">Philippians 4:8</a></h4>
<p>"Finally, brothers and sisters, whatever is true, whatever is noble, whatever is right, whatever is pure, whatever is lovely, whatever is admirable—if anything is excellent or praiseworthy—think about such things."</p>
<h4 class="atx" id="philippians-45"><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Philippians+4%3A5&amp;version=NIV">Philippians 4:5</a></h4>

<h4 class="atx" id="john-663"><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John+6%3A63&amp;version=NIV">John 6:63</a></h4>
<p>"The Spirit gives life; the flesh counts for nothing. The words I have spoken to you—they are full of the Spirit and life."</p>
<h4 class="atx" id="1-corinthians-61-20"><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+Corinthians+6%3A1-20&amp;version=NIV">1 Corinthians 6:1-20</a></h4>
<p>"If any of you has a dispute with another, do you dare to take it before the ungodly for judgment instead of before the Lord's people? ... Do you not know that your bodies are temples of the Holy Spirit, who is in you, whom you have received from God? You are not your own; you were bought at a price. Therefore honor God with your bodies."</p>
<h4 class="atx" id="ephesians-117-18"><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ephesians+1%3A17-18&amp;version=NIV">Ephesians 1:17-18</a></h4>
<p>"I keep asking that the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the glorious Father, may give you the Spirit of wisdom and revelation, so that you may know him better. I pray that the eyes of your heart may be enlightened in order that you may know the hope to which he has called you, the riches of his glorious inheritance in his holy people."</p>
<h4 class="atx" id="philippians-23"><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Philippians+2%3A3&amp;version=NIV">Philippians 2:3</a></h4>
<p>"Do nothing out of selfish ambition or vain conceit. Rather, in humility value others above yourselves."</p>
<h4 class="atx" id="romans-211"><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans+2%3A11&amp;version=NIV">Romans 2:11</a></h4>
<p>"For God does not show favoritism."</p>
<h4 class="atx" id="isaiah-263-4"><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Isaiah+26%3A3-4&amp;version=NIV">Isaiah 26:3-4</a></h4>
<p>"You will keep in perfect peace those whose minds are steadfast, because they trust in you. Trust in the Lord forever, for the Lord, the Lord himself, is the Rock eternal."</p>
<h4 class="atx" id="galatians-219-20"><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Galatians+2%3A19-20&amp;version=NIV">Galatians 2:19-20</a></h4>
<p>"For through the law I died to the law so that I might live for God. I have been crucified with Christ and I no longer live, but Christ lives in me. The life I now live in the body, I live by faith in the Son of God, who loved me and gave himself for me."</p>
<h4 class="atx" id="proverbs-2015"><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Proverbs+20%3A15&amp;version=NIV">Proverbs 20:15</a></h4>
<p>"Gold there is, and rubies in abundance, but lips that speak knowledge are a rare jewel."</p>
<h4 class="atx" id="proverbs-2013"><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Proverbs+20%3A13&amp;version=NIV">Proverbs 20:13</a></h4>
<p>"Do not love sleep or you will grow poor; stay awake and you will have food to spare."</p>
<h4 class="atx" id="proverbs-204"><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Proverbs+20%3A4&amp;version=NIV">Proverbs 20:4</a></h4>
<p>"Sluggards do not plow in season; so at harvest time they look but find nothing."</p>
<h4 class="atx" id="galatians-26"><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Galatians+2%3A6&amp;version=NIV">Galatians 2:6</a></h4>
<p>"As for those who were held in high esteem—whatever they were makes no difference to me; God does not show favoritism—they added nothing to my message."</p>
<h4 class="atx" id="james-317"><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=James+3%3A17&amp;version=NIV">James 3:17</a></h4>

<h4 class="atx" id="jude-117-23"><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Jude+1%3A17-23&amp;version=NIV">Jude 1:17-23</a></h4>
<p>"But, dear friends, remember what the apostles of our Lord Jesus Christ foretold. They said to you, 'In the last times there will be scoffers who will follow their own ungodly desires.' These are the people who divide you, who follow mere natural instincts and do not have the Spirit. But you, dear friends, by building yourselves up in your most holy faith and praying in the Holy Spirit, keep yourselves in God's love as you wait for the mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ to bring you to eternal life. Be merciful to those who doubt; save others by snatching them from the fire; to others show mercy, mixed with fear—hating even the clothing stained by corrupted flesh."</p>
<h4 class="atx" id="1-john-51-15"><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+John+5%3A1-15&amp;version=NIV">1 John 5:1-15</a></h4>
<p>"Everyone who believes that Jesus is the Christ is born of God, and everyone who loves the father loves his child as well. This is how we know that we love the children of God: by loving God and carrying out his commands. ... And this is the testimony: God has given us eternal life, and this life is in his Son. Whoever has the Son has life; whoever does not have the Son of God does not have life."</p>
<h4 class="atx" id="1-john-46"><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+John+4%3A6&amp;version=NIV">1 John 4:6</a></h4>
<p>"We are from God, and whoever knows God listens to us; but whoever is not from God does not listen to us. This is how we recognize the Spirit of truth and the spirit of falsehood."</p>
<h4 class="atx" id="1-john-21-6"><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+John+2%3A1-6&amp;version=NIV">1 John 2:1-6</a></h4>
<p>"My dear children, I write this to you so that you will not sin. But if anybody does sin, we have an advocate with the Father—Jesus Christ, the Righteous One. He is the atoning sacrifice for our sins, and not only for ours but also for the sins of the whole world. We know that we have come to know him if we keep his commands. Whoever says, 'I know him,' but does not do what he commands is a liar, and the truth is not in that person. But if anyone obeys his word, love for God is truly made complete in them. This is how we know we are in him: Whoever claims to live in him must live as Jesus did."</p>
<h4 class="atx" id="1-john-15-10"><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+John+1%3A5-10&amp;version=NIV">1 John 1:5-10</a></h4>
<p>"This is the message we have heard from him and declare to you: God is light; in him there is no darkness at all. If we claim to have fellowship with him and yet walk in the darkness, we lie and do not live out the truth. But if we walk in the light, as he is in the light, we have fellowship with one another, and the blood of Jesus, his Son, purifies us from all sin. If we claim to be without sin, we deceive ourselves and the truth is not in us. If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just and will forgive us our sins and purify us from all unrighteousness. If we claim we have not sinned, we make him out to be a liar and his word is not in us."</p>
<h4 class="atx" id="2-peter-13-8"><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2+Peter+1%3A3-8&amp;version=NIV">2 Peter 1:3-8</a></h4>
<p>"His divine power has given us everything we need for a godly life through our knowledge of him who called us by his own glory and goodness. Through these he has given us his very great and precious promises, so that through them you may participate in the divine nature, having escaped the corruption in the world caused by evil desires. For this very reason, make every effort to add to your faith goodness; and to goodness, knowledge; and to knowledge, self-control; and to self-control, perseverance; and to perseverance, godliness; and to godliness, mutual affection; and to mutual affection, love. For if you possess these qualities in increasing measure, they will keep you from being ineffective and unproductive in your knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ."</p>
<h4 class="atx" id="1-peter-58-11"><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+Peter+5%3A8-11&amp;version=NIV">1 Peter 5:8-11</a></h4>
<p>"Be alert and of sober mind. Your enemy the devil prowls around like a roaring lion looking for someone to devour. Resist him, standing firm in the faith, because you know that the family of believers throughout the world is undergoing the same kind of sufferings. And the God of all grace, who called you to his eternal glory in Christ, after you have suffered a little while, will himself restore you and make you strong, firm and steadfast. To him be the power for ever and ever. Amen."</p>
<h4 class="atx" id="1-peter-52-7"><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+Peter+5%3A2-7&amp;version=NIV">1 Peter 5:2-7</a></h4>
<p>"Be shepherds of God's flock that is under your care, watching over them—not because you must, but because you are willing, as God wants you to be; not pursuing dishonest gain, but eager to serve; not lording it over those entrusted to you, but being examples to the flock. And when the Chief Shepherd appears, you will receive the crown of glory that will never fade away. In the same way, you who are younger, submit yourselves to your elders. All of you, clothe yourselves with humility toward one another, because, 'God opposes the proud but shows favor to the humble.' Humble yourselves, therefore, under God's mighty hand, that he may lift you up in due time. Cast all your anxiety on him because he cares for you."</p>
<h4 class="atx" id="1-peter-52"><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+Peter+5%3A2&amp;version=NIV">1 Peter 5:2</a></h4>
<p>"Be shepherds of God's flock that is under your care, watching over them—not because you must, but because you are willing, as God wants you to be; not pursuing dishonest gain, but eager to serve."</p>
<h4 class="atx" id="1-timothy-614-16"><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+Timothy+6%3A14-16&amp;version=NIV">1 Timothy 6:14-16</a></h4>
<p>"to keep this command without spot or blame until the appearing of our Lord Jesus Christ, which God will bring about in his own time—God, the blessed and only Ruler, the King of kings and Lord of lords, who alone is immortal and who lives in unapproachable light, whom no one has seen or can see. To him be honor and might forever. Amen."</p>
<h4 class="atx" id="1-corinthians-56-8"><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+Corinthians+5%3A6-8&amp;version=NIV">1 Corinthians 5:6-8</a></h4>
<p>"Your boasting is not good. Don't you know that a little yeast leavens the whole batch of dough? Get rid of the old yeast, so that you may be a new unleavened batch—as you really are. For Christ, our Passover lamb, has been sacrificed. Therefore let us keep the Festival, not with the old bread leavened with malice and wickedness, but with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth."</p>
<h4 class="atx" id="romans-1219"><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans+12%3A19&amp;version=NIV">Romans 12:19</a></h4>
<p>"Do not take revenge, my dear friends, but leave room for God's wrath, for it is written: 'It is mine to avenge; I will repay,' says the Lord."</p>
<h4 class="atx" id="isaiah-2610"><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Isaiah+26%3A10&amp;version=NIV">Isaiah 26:10</a></h4>
<p>"But when grace is shown to the wicked, they do not learn righteousness; even in a land of uprightness they go on doing evil and do not regard the majesty of the Lord."</p>
<h4 class="atx" id="psalm-9114-16"><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Psalm+91%3A14-16&amp;version=NIV">Psalm 91:14-16</a></h4>
<p>"'Because he loves me,' says the Lord, 'I will rescue him; I will protect him, for he acknowledges my name. He will call on me, and I will answer him; I will be with him in trouble, I will deliver him and honor him. With long life I will satisfy him and show him my salvation.'"</p>
<h4 class="atx" id="psalm-9114"><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Psalm+91%3A14&amp;version=NIV">Psalm 91:14</a></h4>
<p>"'Because he loves me,' says the Lord, 'I will rescue him; I will protect him, for he acknowledges my name.'"</p>
<h4 class="atx" id="matthew-1037-42"><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+10%3A37-42&amp;version=NIV">Matthew 10:37-42</a></h4>
<p>"Anyone who loves their father or mother more than me is not worthy of me; anyone who loves their son or daughter more than me is not worthy of me. Whoever does not take up their cross and follow me is not worthy of me. Whoever finds their life will lose it, and whoever loses their life for my sake will find it. Anyone who welcomes you welcomes me, and anyone who welcomes me welcomes the one who sent me. Whoever welcomes a prophet as a prophet will receive a prophet's reward, and whoever welcomes a righteous person as a righteous person will receive a righteous person's reward. And if anyone gives even a cup of cold water to one of these little ones who is my disciple, truly I tell you, that person will certainly not lose their reward."</p>
<h4 class="atx" id="2-kings-113"><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2+Kings+1%3A13&amp;version=NIV">2 Kings 1:13</a></h4>
<p>"So the king sent a third captain with his fifty men. This third captain went up and fell on his knees before Elijah. 'Man of God,' he begged, 'please have respect for my life and the lives of these fifty men, your servants!'"</p>
<h4 class="atx" id="2-timothy-12"><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2+Timothy+1%3A2&amp;version=NIV">2 Timothy 1:2</a></h4>

<p>"When tempted, no one should say, 'God is tempting me.' For God cannot be tempted by evil, nor does he tempt anyone; but each person is tempted when they are dragged away by their own evil desire and enticed. Then, after desire has conceived, it gives birth to sin; and sin, when it is full-grown, gives birth to death. Don't be deceived, my dear brothers and sisters. Every good and perfect gift is from above, coming down from the Father of the heavenly lights, who does not change like shifting shadows. He chose to give us birth through the word of truth, that we might be a kind of firstfruits of all he created."</p>

<p>"My dear brothers and sisters, take note of this: Everyone should be quick to listen, slow to speak and slow to become angry, because human anger does not produce the righteousness that God desires. Therefore, get rid of all moral filth and the evil that is so prevalent and humbly accept the word planted in you, which can save you. Do not merely listen to the word, and so deceive yourselves. Do what it says. Anyone who listens to the word but does not do what it says is like someone who looks at his face in a mirror and, after looking at himself, goes away and immediately forgets what he looks like. But whoever looks intently into the perfect law that gives freedom, and continues in it—not forgetting what they have heard, but doing it—they will be blessed in what they do. Those who consider themselves religious and yet do not keep a tight rein on their tongues deceive themselves, and their religion is worthless. Religion that God our Father accepts as pure and faultless is this: to look after orphans and widows in their distress and to keep oneself from being polluted by the world."</p>

<p>"Consider it pure joy, my brothers and sisters, whenever you face trials of many kinds, because you know that the testing of your faith produces perseverance. Let perseverance finish its work so that you may be mature and complete, not lacking anything. If any of you lacks wisdom, you should ask God, who gives generously to all without finding fault, and it will be given to you. But when you ask, you must believe and not doubt, because the one who doubts is like a wave of the sea, blown and tossed by the wind. That person should not expect to receive anything from the Lord. Such a person is double-minded and unstable in all they do. Blessed is the one who perseveres under trial because, having stood the test, that person will receive the crown of life that the Lord has promised to those who love him. When tempted, no one should say, 'God is tempting me.' For God cannot be tempted by evil, nor does he tempt anyone; but each person is tempted when they are dragged away by their own evil desire and enticed. Then, after desire has conceived, it gives birth to sin; and sin, when it is full-grown, gives birth to death."</p>

Stand firm then, with the belt of truth buckled around your waist, with the breastplate of righteousness in place, and with your feet fitted with the readiness that comes from the gospel of peace. In addition to all this, take up the shield of faith, with which you can extinguish all the flaming arrows of the evil one.
